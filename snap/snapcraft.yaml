summary: Fortran Standard Library
description: |
  The Fortran Standard, as published by the ISO (https://wg5-fortran.org/), does not have a 
  Standard Library. The goal of this project is to provide a community driven and agreed upon 
  de facto "standard" library for Fortran, called a Fortran Standard Library (stdlib). We have a   
  rigorous process how stdlib is developed as documented in our Workflow. stdlib is both a
  specification and a reference implementation. We are cooperating with the Fortran Standards 
  Committee (e.g., the effort started at the J3 committee repository) and the plan is to continue
  working with the Committee in the future (such as in the step 5. in the Workflow document), 
  so that if the Committee wants to standardize some feature already available in stdlib, 
  it would base it on stdlib's implementation.
